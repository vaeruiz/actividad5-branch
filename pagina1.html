        <h2>Sinopsis</h2>
        <p>In 1979, the United States collapsed, leading to massive civil unrest and economic collapse. The government was restructured in a totalitarian regime under martial law. To pacify the population, the government has organized the Transcontinental
            Road Race, where a group of drivers is driving across the country in their high-powered cars, infamous for violence, gore and innocent pedestrians hit by bonus points.</p>

        <p>In the year 2000, the five pilots of the 20th annual race, who adhere to professional wrestling people and properly drive the thematic cars, include Frankenstein, the mysterious champion dressed in black and national hero; Machine Gun Joe, a tough
            guy gangster from Chicago; Calamity Jane, a cowgirl; Matilda El huno, a neo-Nazi; And Nero the hero, a Roman gladiator. Each unit with a browser of the opposite sex, which also implicitly functions as a love interest. The race is covered on
            national television by a news team headed by the bustling and comic Junior Bruce, the seductive matron Grace Pander, and the laconic commentator Harold (a parody of Howard Cosell). The game has sadistic rules, where killing babies and disabled
            people will give the player extra points. Machine Gun Joe is the main opposition to Frankenstein.</p>
        <img src="img/portada.jpg" width="300" alt="portada">
        <p>A resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of the American revolutionary Thomas Paine, plans to rebel against the president's regime by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers and taking Frankenstein hostage as a lever against
            the president. The group is assisted by the great-granddaughter of Paine Annie, the last navigator of Frankenstein. She plans to lure him into an ambush to be replaced by a double. Despite a pirated national broadcast made by Mrs. Paine herself,
            the breakdown of the resistance of the race is covered by the government and instead blamed the French, who are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and system telephone.</p>

        <p>At first, the Resistance plan works. Nero is killed when he runs on a doll trapped by the Resistance, who makes a mistake for a real baby and proceeds to execute it to earn points. Matilda leads a cliff while following a false detour created by
            the Resistance. Calamity Jane inadvertently drives a land mine. This leaves only Frankenstein and the machine gun Joe in the race.</p>

        <p>As Frankenstein does not survive all the attempts made in his life during the race, Annie comes to discover that the Frankenstein she knows is anything, but he is not a willing government official, nor is he the original man. The current Frankenstein
            is, in fact, one of a number of random wings of the state trained exclusively to race in identity. "When one runs out, they bring another," he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also reveals that he has his own plans: when he wins the race
            and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will detonate a grenade that has been implanted in his right hand prosthesis (he calls it "hand grenade"), which he has kept hidden keeping his glove on at all times (even while undressing). His plan
            goes awry, however, when machine gun Joe attacks and Annie kills him using Frankenstein's "hand" grenade.
        </p>

        <p>Having successfully surpassed rival pilots and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner, although he is injured and unable to carry out his original grenade attack plan. Annie prefers Frankenstein's costume and plans to stab Mr. President
            while on the podium. While the president congratulates "Frankenstein" for his victory, in the process declaring war on the French and naming Frankenstein as war leader, Annie is hurt by her own grandmother, desperate for revenge against Frankenstein
            for allegedly killing her during the career (he had only really drugged her). The real Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and caresses the president's stage with his car, finally fulfilling his desire to kill him for a lifetime.</p>

        <p>In the epilogue, Annie and Frankenstein get married. Frankenstein, now President, suppresses the race and plans to rebuild the country. However, Junior Bruce begins to protest against her. When he cannot find a moral reason to continue the career,
            he begins to shout that it is a way of life, to keep America satisfied, to entertain and give people what they want, now desperate for the race to perpetuate. Annoying Frankenstein runs him with his car and goes with Annie to the applause
            and applause of the crowd.</p>
